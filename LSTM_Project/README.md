LSTM_Project:

Long-Short Term Memory algorithms. The goal of the project was to demonstrate the benefits of Recurrent Neural Networks for approximating any mathematical function while dealing with the Vanishing Gradient problem. I worked in two different applications for LSTM: Text Classification in movie reviews and Time Series prediction for temperatures in a city.

For the first, I compared LSTM Networks applying first Regularization techniques and then combining these with Convolutional Networks. The algorithms were implemented using the Keras module and the results showed an accuracy of +80% which is very good. The results are planned to be the base for a further study in the field of Sentiment analysis.

For the second application, I worked on predicting 1 year in advance of temperatures in a given city. The complexity laid in an adequate validation for the time series. It was solved using the technique of Backtesting. The accuracy of the predictions with RMSE was proven to be good.
